We have long sought to model how businesses can lead in driving the reduction of global carbon emissions. Our green bonds have been an important tool for Apple to demonstrate that leadership. We issued our first 1.5 billion green bond in February 2016 and our second 1 billion dollar green bond in June 2017 to help drive projects to mitigate our impact on climate change and inspire others to do the same. Both of these green bonds are now fully allocated.
In November 2019, we proceeded with our third green bond issuance, and our first in Europe — raising 2 billion (approximately 2.2 billion dollar) across two tranches (the “2019 Green Bond”). The 2019 Green Bond supports Apple’s ambitious goal to reach carbon neutrality across our entire carbon footprint, including the full product life cycle, by 2030. We aim to leverage product design and engineering, energy efficiency, renewable energy, and direct emissions abatement to reduce emissions by 75 percent by 2030, compared with
fiscal year 2015 levels. We then plan to address residual emissions that are not otherwise avoidable today by investing in carbon removal solutions. The eligibility criteria of the 2019 Green Bond are aligned with the pillars of our 2030 plan.
This year’s annual impact report covers the cumulative allocation of Apple’s 2019 Green Bond proceeds to environmental projects that incurred spend between September 29, 2019, and September 25, 2021 — Apple’s 2020 and 2021 fiscal years.
Since February 2016, Apple has issued a total of 4.7 billion in green bonds, with 3 billion allocated to date.
The 2019 Green Bond proceeds are intended to support the execution of Apple’s 2030 carbon neutrality roadmap. Our Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives team leads an annual evaluation and project selection process to identify projects eligible for green bond proceeds. The final allocation of net proceeds to eligible projects is determined by our vice president of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives, based on each project’s alignment with the 2030 carbon neutrality roadmap and projected ability to reduce greenhouse gas emissions across Apple’s value chain.1 All of the selected projects meet at least one of the following 2019 Green Bond eligibility criteria:  “Low carbon” design and engineering, Energy efficiency, Renewable energy, Carbon mitigation, Carbon sequestration.
Featured projects
In fiscal year 2021, we continued to expand the projects that support our 2030 carbon neutrality goal, with investments in R&D, environmental initiatives and renewable energy. What follows are select examples of the projects to which Apple allocated 2019 Green Bond funds in fiscal year 2021. The full list of projects with detailed descriptions and key performance indicators was provided to Sustainalytics for their second- party review.
Manufacturing efficiency
By reducing material waste and increasing energy efficiency in our product manufacturing processes, we can reduce the carbon intensity of our assembled products. This is an essential element to reducing Apple’s overall carbon footprint. In fiscal year 2021, we allocated green bond funds to a number of projects researching improved efficiency in manufacturing processes. These projects are aimed at creating less waste in the processing of different materials, reducing machining time and the associated energy used, more efficiently transforming material into the shapes we need, and maximizing recovery and reprocessing of manufacturing scrap. Once successfully developed, we plan to deploy these improved processes at scale at our supplier facilities.
Carbon footprint modeling improvements
As our low-carbon manufacturing processes evolve, so do our techniques for measuring Apple’s footprint. We allocated green bond funds in fiscal year 2021 to several projects intended to improve the fidelity, scalability, speed, and breadth of Apple’s carbon models, and to improve the carbon modeling of Apple’s use of new recycled content in products.
Recycled materials
The use of recycled materials is central to our goal of making carbon- neutral products by 2030. Incorporating recovered materials into our design process has already helped us lower the carbon footprint of the products we create. But to maximize the use of recycled content, additional research and development is needed to address challenges of retaining the material purity necessary for use in Apple products, as impurities are often introduced in the material scrap recovery process. In fiscal year 2021, we allocated green bond funds to projects that are investigating ways to remove such impurities from materials so they can be reused in Apple products instead of being downcycled.
Low-carbon aluminum
In May 2018, Apple partnered with aluminum companies and the governments of Canada and Quebec to invest in Elysis — a joint venture to commercialize patented technology that eliminates direct greenhouse gas emissions from the traditional smelting process. This is a revolutionary advancement in the manufacturing of one of the world’s most widely used metals. As part of Apple’s commitment to reducing the environmental impact of our products through innovation, we helped accelerate the development of this technology by facilitating the joint partnership, and providing initial funding and ongoing technical support. We continue to support this project, disbursing additional funds in fiscal year 2021 toward our original 10 million commitment. In spring 2022, Elysis announced it had built out a commercial-scale prototype within its R&D center in Quebec—enabling Elysis to begin producing commercial purity primary aluminum at scale. This milestone for the project prompted Apple to make an additional purchase of the aluminum, with plans to use it for iPhone SE. In 2019, Apple purchased the first-ever commercial batch of aluminum resulting from the joint venture, using it in the production of the 16-inch MacBook Pro.
Since 2018, all of our offices, retail stores, and data centers across 44 countries have sourced 100 percent renewable energy. We continue to invest in renewable energy projects to keep pace with the growth of Apple’s facilities and add new electricity to the grids in which we operate around the world. In fiscal year 2021, we allocated part of the 2019 Green Bond proceeds to a range of projects to maintain this goal. For projects representing a long-term financial commitment, we allocated 2019 Green Bond proceeds based on the net present value of the project’s cost as of the time the project became operational. Select projects to which we allocated 2019 Green Bond proceeds in fiscal year 2021 include: 
Wind project in Denmark: To support our data center in Denmark, we secured a power purchase agreement for a 16.8-megawatt (MW) wind project near the town of Esbjerg, Denmark. The project features two 200-meter-tall turbines — the world’s largest onshore wind turbines — that are expected to produce 62 gigawatt-hours each year, enough to power almost 20,000 homes. The power produced onsite will support Apple’s data center in Viborg, with all surplus energy going into the Danish grid. The project will also act as a test site for powerful offshore wind turbines. Our agreement to purchase the electricity at an established price has helped make this effort financially viable. The project became operational in November 2020.
Solar project in Virginia: Outside of Fredericksburg, Virginia, we’ve helped to realize a renewable energy aggregation project, which brings together multiple buyers in a single energy transaction. For this 165 MW project, we worked with our partners Akamai, Swiss Re, and Etsy to help attain economies of scale through our collective purchasing power. In fiscal year 2021, we allocated green bond proceeds toward a 133.6 MW portion of this project, which became operational in December 2020. 
Nevada Turquoise project: We allocated fiscal year 2021 green bond proceeds to the Nevada Turquoise solar project, which became operational in December 2020. The 50 MW long-term power purchase agreement (PPA) is facilitated by the Nevada Green Rider. Apple helped create this innovative financial deal structure with NV Energy and the Nevada utility commission to further guarantee that there is a green energy option open to all commercial customers, which does not require the customer to fund project development up front. The project supports electricity use at our data center in Reno, Nevada.

Reducing emissions in Apple’s supply chain
The energy used to manufacture Apple products represents over 70 percent of Apple’s comprehensive carbon footprint. That’s why we’re investing in programs that help suppliers reduce their energy use and transition to renewable energy. In fiscal year 2021, we’ve continued to allocate green bond proceeds to both our Supplier Energy Efficiency Program and our Supplier Clean Energy Program.

Supplier Energy Efficiency Program
The Supplier Energy Efficiency Program has three aims: to educate suppliers, identify initiatives to reduce energy use, and provide support for successful project completion. Historically, we’ve prioritized facilities with the highest energy use and potential for improvement. More recently, we’ve focused on supplier facilities by product line, like iPhone, which represents a significant percentage of Apple’s manufacturing footprint. To help suppliers reduce their energy use, we train them to uncover opportunities for energy efficiency and assist them with assessments and technical issues where appropriate. Typical projects may include replacing outdated or inefficient heating, cooling, and lighting systems; repairing compressed air leaks; and recovering waste heat. As of the end of fiscal year 2021, 102 facilities are participating in our Supplier Energy Efficiency Program.

Supplier Clean Energy Program
The Supplier Clean Energy Program launched in 2015 to help suppliers transition to renewable energy for Apple production. Apple’s goal is to transition our entire manufacturing supply chain to 100 percent renewable energy by 2030. As of October 2021, more than 175 manufacturing partners in 24 different countries have committed to 100 percent renewable energy for Apple production. In fiscal year 2021, we allocated 2019 Green Bond proceeds to the following aspects of the Supplier Clean Energy Program:
Capacity building. We work to share with our suppliers the knowledge we’ve gained through our own transition to 100 percent renewable energy. We provide suppliers with resources and training materials that contain country-specific information to guide them in their transition to renewables. These tools are available through our Supplier Clean Energy Portal. We also educate suppliers through advanced and customized training with leading experts. And we support the creation and growth of renewable energy industry associations that our suppliers can join to learn about local opportunities. We’re also empowering supplier-facing employees with the tools and training they need to support our mission and speed a supplier’s transition to renewable energy. By connecting our suppliers with resources and helping them assess their performance, our teams are scaling impact across our supply chain. 
Advocating for strong policy. Government policies and rules can present some of the most significant barriers to transitioning to renewables. We actively support policies that create cost-effective renewable energy markets, and work closely with suppliers and other companies to engage local, regional, and national governments. This advocacy encourages the development of country-specific policies that support scalable renewable energy solutions, with a potential for impact far beyond Apple’s supply chain. In fiscal year 2021, we allocated 2019 Green Bond proceeds to policy advocacy efforts in Japan, Vietnam, and South Korea. 
Expanding renewable energy opportunities. The transition to renewables involves helping our suppliers find energy solutions and making the right investments to address their specific needs. When we face barriers in accessing cost-effective clean energy, we innovate. That’s why we developed the China Clean Energy Fund. The fund enables Apple and our suppliers to invest in clean energy — to date, these projects account for 134 MW in renewable power. We’ve also invested in a total of nearly 500 MW of renewable energy solutions to cover upstream emissions in our supply chain, including a recent 20 MW project to which we allocated 2019 Green Bond proceeds in fiscal year 2021.

Nature-based solutions 
To reach carbon neutrality for our products by 2030, Apple is investing in projects that create additional carbon removal through Apple’s Restore Fund. As we’re working to bring these projects online, we’re purchasing high-quality carbon offsets to address some of our unavoidable emissions in the short term. In fiscal year 2021, we allocated green bond proceeds to the purchase of high-quality carbon credits from projects in Guatemala and China. The first, a REDD+ coastal conservation project in Guatemala, protects and conserves forests from deforestation and degradation caused by illegal encroachment of subsistence farmers and cattle ranchers into forests. The second project aims to establish forests on about 46,000 hectares of barren land that is not otherwise in use across seven counties in the Guizhou Province of China. Both projects are certified under the Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) and the Climate, Community & Biodiversity Standards (CCBS).
